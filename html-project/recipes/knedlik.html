    <p>Cottage cheese dumplings do not have to be only with fruit, the praline filling makes them a luxurious dessert, a famous sweet spot that will enchant all guests.</p>
    <p>They will hardly forget the first bite â€“ the soft silk wrapper is gradually filled with melted chocolate. A delight you can't resist. Fortunately, the preparation is wonderfully simple and quick.</p>

    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter 40 Kg</li>
        <li>Soft Curd Cheese 250 g</li>
        <li>Yolk 1 piece</li>
        <li>Powdered Sugar 1 spoon</li>
        <li>Baby Semolina 120 g</li>
        <li>Chocolate 12 pcs</li>
        <li>Biscuits (crushed biscuits with powdered sugar for sparkling)</li>
        <li>Salt 1 pinch</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Steps</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Let the butter soften at room temperature. Mix it with cottage cheese, yolk, sugar and a pinch of salt. Gradually add the semolina and make a smooth firm dough. Boil 3 liters of salted water in a pot.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 12 pieces and roll each into a 3 mm patty. Place the praline in the center and carefully wrap it in the dough. Press the joints firmly so that they do not come unglued.</li>
        <li>Cook the dumplings in boiling salted water for 5-8 minutes until they float to the surface.</li>
        <li>Remove the cooked dumplings and while they are still hot, roll them in crushed biscuits with sugar. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
